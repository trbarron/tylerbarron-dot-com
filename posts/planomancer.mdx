## The Game

[Planomancer](https://planomancer.com) is a deterministic, pre-programmed card battler. You build a 6-card plan — 1 planomancer and 6 creatures — schedule every move across 15 turns, and watch your strategy execute automatically

The core loop is to craft your plan, submit it, and let it battle all challengers asynchronously. You must defeat all the predetermined "Trials" before you can submit to the PvP tournament at the end of the season

## Inspiration

The game draws from:

- **[MTG 3 Card Blind](https://www.3cardblind.com/)**
- **[Super Auto Pets](https://teamwoodgames.com/)**
- **[Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com)**
- and plenty more

The result is something that I'm pretty happy with and excited to see how it plays out
