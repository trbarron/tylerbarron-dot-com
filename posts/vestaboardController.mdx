## What It Does

The [Vestaboard](https://www.vestaboard.com/) is one of those split-flap displays that looks like an old airport departure board. Vestaboard sells a subscription service to customize what it shows, but I figured I could write a Python script to do it myself and save $7/month.

The script updates the display every 20 minutes with:
- **Current Weather**: Temperature and precipitation chance
- **Work/Activity Time**: Pulls data from [my cat work tracker](https://tylerbarron.com/cat-tracker)
- **Custom Counter**: How long it's been since a date
- **Quiet Hours**: Pauses at night (11 PM - 6 AM) so the clicking doesn't wake anyone up

## The Technical Approach

The controller is built in Python and uses:
- **Vestaboard's Read/Write API** for direct board control
- **OpenWeatherMap API** for weather data
- **Custom time tracking endpoint** that integrates with my personal activity tracker
- **Cron job monitoring** to ensure the script stays running and auto-restarts

The script runs continuously, respecting quiet hours and updating the board with fresh information throughout the day. A simple shell script monitors the process and automatically restarts it if needed.

## Why Build This?

Mostly to save some money, but also because it's a fun little project. The board only has 22 columns and 6 rows of characters, so you have to get creative with how you fit everything.

If you want to add more stuff to display, it's pretty straightforward - grab your data from wherever, format it to fit the grid, and send it to the API.
