### The Problem

Being a 30 something who works from home, I find myself constantly listening to DJ mixes on YouTube. This has inspired me to get into DJing myself, which was on my [2026 Goals](/blog/2026Goals). Because of how I discover music, I often have screenshots of track names, and the tracks are often not on Spotify or Apple Music yet. This prompted me to want to build a tool to take a track name and easily turn it into a local file I could use in my DJing setup. This is what led to the creation of this project to do exactly that.

### What It Does

It's a Discord bot that handles the searching, downloading, and organization of a track. Send a message like `!dl Daft Punk - Around the World`, and it will:

- **Download the audio** from YouTube via `yt-dlp`
- **Analyze the track** to extract BPM, musical key, and energy profile
- **Organize automatically** into BPM-range folders (e.g., 120-125 BPM) on my local NAS

The discord bot also supports searching your library, listing songs by BPM range, and checking queue status.

### The Details

This runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with music stored on a NAS. It runs as a discord bot and is triggered by a message in a specific channel, which gave an easy way to give access to it on the go and from home

tools used:
- **py-cord** for the Discord bot interface
- **yt-dlp** for YouTube downloads
- **aubio** for BPM and key detection
- **SQLite** for tracking the library and preventing duplicates
