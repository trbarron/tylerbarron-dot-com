## The Inspiration

Stardew Valley is an amazing game, but after a few playthroughs you can look for a bit more, often landing you in the world of mods

I was inspired by [Josh Fonseca's incredible work](https://joshfonseca.com/blogs/animal-crossing-llm) replacing Animal Crossing dialogue with a live LLM by hacking GameCube memory. His approach involved memory manipulation and reverse engineering, I realized Stardew Valley's modding ecosystem ([SMAPI](https://smapi.io/)) made this much more accessible

## The Result

I built a mod that intercepts character dialogue and replaces it with responses generated by OpenAI's LLM

This includes:
- **Character Personalities**: Each character has a detailed personality profile that guides the AI's responses. This can be customized
- **Context Awareness**: The LLM is provided with the game state (season, weather, time, player activities) to generate relevant dialogue

The project integrates AI into one of my favorite games, showing how modern language models can do what they do best -- creating text based on text. This can be used to maintain the character's personalities and simply give them new dialog or can be extended to modify character's personalities

For example, I modified Alex's character to be obsessed with Formula 1 racing and Lewis Hamilton
