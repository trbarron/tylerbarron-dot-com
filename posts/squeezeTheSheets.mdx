## The Problem

> Two identical sheets have equally spaced ridges on one side. When the sheets are squeezed together with the ridges facing each other, what spacing maximizes the empty volume between them?

> Which value of L (the spacing between ridges) maximizes the empty space between the sheets?


## My Approach to Finding the Maximum

To find the greatest value, we created a simulation and ran it for each value of `L`

This led to us seeing the solution for `2.83`. This was confirmed by hand, using math (as intended)

I have made the code used for this available [here](https://gist.github.com/trbarron/e0faa616a4b89e1ab4e3f0fb08159920) in case others would like to view it
