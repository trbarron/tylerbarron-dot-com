## Overview
Every year I set goals for myself. These are individual goals that I hope to accomplish put into the 3 major categories: Personal, Professional, and Physical. Here were my goals and review of how I did, along with forward facing goals for 2026. 

# 2025
## Personal

### Projects
* Be a guest on a podcast or contribute to someone else's project
<mark>I did not accomplish this</mark>
<mark>I am now openly making jokes about wanting to start a podcast so that is progress</mark>
* Do one public work outside my comfort zone (Stand up comedy, hosting a taskmaster event, improv class thing, present at the moth, etc)
<mark>No attempts, no progress</mark>
* Write 6 articles to post to my blog
<mark>This is number six!</mark>
### Chess
* Have 3 games I'm very proud of (at least one over the board!)
<mark>I had some sequences that I can remember being proud of. I would give myself a low passing mark here</mark>
* Add to the chess community with a project (Collaborative Checkmate? Writing on the atomic chess betting? Helping with the chess club?)
<mark>I made Collaborative Checkmate and added leaderboards to Chesser Guesser. I did some work on armageddon chess betting</mark>
### Environmental
* Actually use re-usable grocery bags (6 strikes allowed / year)
<mark>This was a great goal and I actually did it</mark>
<mark>Ordering groceries killed this one though</mark>
* Source 75% of my clothes from second-hand stores for the year
<mark>Did great until the last quarter of the year. I still think I held to the spirit of the goal</mark>

## Professional  

- Establish myself as someone who can lead a team
<mark>Yep.</mark>
- Creating a "management learning journal" with monthly entries about lessons learned
<mark>I did not do this</mark>
- Reading 4 management/leadership books and implementing key takeaways
<mark>I ended up reading a lot about management & leadership and implemented lots of takeaways</mark>
- Navigate creating a good work:life balance with my added responsibilities and workload
<mark>Unfortunately I failed here.</mark>

<mark>Overall I think I turned myself into a pretty good manager. I was proud of the team that I had build and the work that I was doing. A majority of this improvement came through soft skills, which was born from reading, LLMing and working with my professional coach</mark>
<mark>A lot of my coworkers cosigned this -- mentioning that I was a much stronger manager compared to when I'd started. I feel really good about the growth I'd made here. </mark>
<mark>That being said, I'm excited to be an IC again. I'm really jazzed to jump into AI tooling and hone my craft through building things</mark>

## Physical  
### Fitness  
* Do something active (even small) 2.5x night a week (total of 130)
<mark>I have 155 logged activities over the year</mark>
* Go on 52 runs over the year
<mark> I went on 12 runs. indoor biking really was the theme of the year</mark>
* Develop a tennis serve I am proud of
<mark>I did not improve my serve by a lot</mark>
* Join a local tennis club
<mark>Tennis has become a social sport and I am happy with that</mark>
* Cycle a century
<mark>I did this!</mark>
* Get to the half lotus pose
<mark>lol no</mark>

### Diet
* Stay veggie
<mark>Yep!</mark>
* Make a perfect Pad See Ew
<mark>No but I did get a pretty good pad thai</mark>
* Cook through 6 different legume/bean preparations with full dinners (aka black bean burgers, hummus, lentil dal, chickpea masala, etc.) #TheYearOfTheLegume
<mark>The Year of the Legume was good! I expanded my knowledge of the legume and found it fun to dive deeper into a specific food category. I only added 2 new meals to my rotation but tried at least 6</mark>


<mark>Overall I am giving myself a B. I think I generally followed the goals and while I came up short on a lot of them I also had some quality achievements. I'm happy with this year and my individual growth</mark>
