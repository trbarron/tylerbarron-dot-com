# Migration to React Router 7 - Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Package Updates
- **Removed**: `@remix-run/architect`, `@remix-run/node`, `@remix-run/react`, `@remix-run/dev`, `@remix-run/serve`
- **Added**: `react-router`, `@react-router/dev`, `@react-router/node`, `@ballatech/react-router7-preset-aws`
- **Updated**: `remix-utils` → `react-router-utils`

### 2. Configuration Files
- ✅ Created `react-router.config.ts` (replaced `remix.config.js`)
- ✅ Updated `vite.config.ts` to use `@react-router/dev/vite`
- ✅ Updated `tsconfig.json` to reference `react-router.env.d.ts`
- ✅ Created `react-router.env.d.ts` (replaced `remix.env.d.ts`)
- ✅ Deleted old `remix.config.js` and `remix.env.d.ts`

### 3. Server Configuration
- ✅ Updated `server.ts` to use `@ballatech/react-router7-preset-aws`
- This adapter is specifically designed to replace `@remix-run/architect` for AWS deployments

### 4. Build Scripts
Updated in `package.json`:
- `build`: `remix build` → `react-router build`
- `dev`: `remix dev` → `react-router dev`
- `start`: `remix-serve` → `react-router-serve`

### 5. Code Updates
Updated all imports across the codebase:
- `@remix-run/react` → `react-router`
- `@remix-run/node` → `@react-router/node`
- `RemixBrowser` → `HydratedRouter`
- `RemixServer` → `ServerRouter`
- Removed `LiveReload` component (no longer needed in React Router 7)

#### Files Updated:
- `app/root.tsx`
- `app/entry.client.tsx`
- `app/entry.server.tsx`
- `app/components/Footer.tsx`
- `app/components/Navbar.tsx`
- All route files in `app/routes/`

### 6. Documentation
- ✅ Updated `README.md` to reference React Router 7

## Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the new React Router 7 packages and remove the old Remix packages.

### 2. Test Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

Verify that:
- The dev server starts without errors
- All routes load correctly
- Loaders and actions work as expected
- WebSocket functionality (Collaborative Checkmate) still works
- S3 integration (blog posts) works correctly

### 3. Run Type Checking
```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Fix any TypeScript errors that may arise.

### 4. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

Ensure the build completes successfully.

### 5. Deploy to AWS
The `@ballatech/react-router7-preset-aws` adapter should work with your existing AWS Architect setup. However, you may need to:
- Clear any cached Lambda layers
- Verify that the `server/index.mjs` path in your deployment matches the new build output
- Test the deployment in a staging environment first

## Potential Issues to Watch For

### 1. Type Errors
- Some loader/action function signatures may have changed slightly
- The `json()` helper may need to be imported differently in some files
- If you see type errors, check the [React Router 7 migration guide](https://reactrouter.com/dev/guides/migrating-to-v7)

### 2. Build Output
- The build output location may have changed slightly
- Check that your AWS deployment still points to the correct files

### 3. Package Versions
Some packages may have different version requirements. If you encounter peer dependency warnings, you may need to update:
- `react` and `react-dom` (currently on 18.2.0, might want to update to latest)
- Other dependencies that had peer dependencies on Remix packages

### 4. react-router-utils
The `remix-utils` package has been replaced with `react-router-utils` in the config. You may need to verify this package exists and has the same API, or you might need to use `remix-utils` (which should still work) or migrate to React Router 7's built-in utilities.

## Breaking Changes from Remix v2 to React Router 7

Since you already had all the v3 future flags enabled, you shouldn't encounter major breaking changes. However, note:

1. **No more `LiveReload`**: React Router 7 handles this automatically
2. **Updated entry files**: The browser/server components have new names
3. **Type imports**: Some types are now exported from different packages

## Rollback Plan

If you encounter issues and need to rollback:

1. Revert all changes: `git checkout HEAD -- .`
2. Run `npm install` to restore old packages
3. The commit before this migration will have all the Remix code intact

## Notes

- React Router 7 is essentially Remix v3, so this is more of an upgrade than a complete rewrite
- Your existing code patterns should continue to work with minimal changes
- The AWS Architect adapter replacement (`@ballatech/react-router7-preset-aws`) is community-maintained and specifically designed for this use case
